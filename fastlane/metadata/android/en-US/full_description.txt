<p><i>Spirit level</i> uses your device's build in sensors to help you keep things level, when nothing else is at hand. The app is built with simplicity, compatibility, and app size in mind to ensure it works everywhere.</p>
<p>The app should work out of the box without calibration. In case your phone has a camera or something else sticking out, and you can't position it in such a way that this doesn't offset the device's rotation, you will need a level reference surface to calibrate.</p>
