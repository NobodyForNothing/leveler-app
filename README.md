### Opening bugs and testing
This is probably the simplest to do: Just use the app and find out what's wrong and what can be improved. There is no such thing as a wrong issue. Just make sure there is no existing one about the exact same topic If you are unsure about something just create a new issue, worst thing to happen is that it gets closed.
